For Cyber Security Awareness Month, the team at Huntress ran a CTF through the month of October with new challenges released daily. Over time, the challenges would also increase in difficulty (depending on your skillset and Google-fu!).

This was the second year taking part in this competition and yet again I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learnings!

I was invited to join a team this year, which I am so glad that I did _(and not just down to the unfavourable challenge release time for UK folks (with kids) this year!)_. I benefited from camaraderie and knowledge sharing. It is always great seeing other approaches to solving problems and splitting the workload, especially with multiple task releases!

Our team **5 dogs in a trenchcoat** - completed 99% of the challenges; finishing in 50th place overall. Turns out we had been staring the data for our missing flag in the face for the final 24 hours or so, but just hadn't clicked things together in time before the final buzzer!

In the links below I'll be providing my solutions to the challenges which are grouped together by category. **Note: some challenges listed had already been solved by teammates, but I still wanted to walkthrough my process to each problem for getting the flag.**
