For Cyber Security Awareness Month, the team at Huntress ran a CTF through the month of October with new challenges released daily. Over time, the challenges would also increase in difficulty (depending on your skillset and Google-fu!).

I'm happy to report that I managed to complete 100% of the challenges; finishing in 36th place overall and according to _RickAstley (BOT)_, I also made 10th in terms of single person teams!

In the links below I'll be providing my solutions to the challenges which are grouped together by category. Other content and solutions for the CTF can be found on social media (X, LinkedIn at least) by searching `#HuntressCTF`.
