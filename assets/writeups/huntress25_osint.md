# Follow The Money

> Hey Support Team,
> We had a bit of an issue yesterday that I need you to look into ASAP. There's been a possible case of money fraud involving our client, Harbor Line Bank. They handle a lot of transfers for real estate down payments, but the most recent one doesn't appear to have gone through correctly.
> Here's the deal, we need to figure out what happened and where the money might have gone. The titling company is looping in their incident response firm to investigate from their end. I need you to quietly review things on our end and see what you can find. Keep it discreet and be passive.
> I let Evelyn over at Harbor Line know that someone from our team might reach out. Her main email is offline right now just in case it was compromised, she's using a temporary address until things get sorted out:

`evelyn.carter@51tjxh.onmicrosoft.com`
