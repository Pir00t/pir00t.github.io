# Land Before Time

_This trick is nothing new, you know what to do: iSteg. Look for the tail that's older than time, this Spike, you shouldn't climb._

Given that the name of the tool is in the description, I downloaded `iSteg` from [GitHub](https://github.com/rafiibrahim8/iSteg/releases/download/v2.1/iSteg-v2.1_GUI.jar). The quickest way to run the tool is:

```bash
java -jar iSteg-v2.01_CLI.jar
```

From the GUI, select "Reveal file/message and provide the path to the the file. Click "Do It" to be provided with the flag:

**`flag{da1e2bf9951c9eb1c33b1d2008064fee}`**
