<i class="fa fa-history"></i>
<br>
Worked alongside <a href="https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/owen-lo" target="_blank"> Dr Owen Lo</a> as part of a summer internship (2016) on his research project; <i>Practical side-channel attacks on embedded device cryptography</i>. <br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>The work focussed on attacks based on monitoring the power consumption of a device. In particular, the aim was to present the findings on performing power analysis attacks against the AES-128 algorithm by monitoring the power consumption of a microcontroller (Arduino Uno) while cryptographic operations take place.</i></blockquote>

My primary contribution was establishing an efficient method of parsing the power analysis output for both attack methods discussed (CPA, DPA), in order to recover the 16-byte cipher key. A presentation of the overall work, including the usage of my <strong>Python Script</strong> for obtaining the cipher key can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D-Hr4Nw0T4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.

I'm a big fan of self learning and continued development. When time allows, I actively participate on sites such as <a href="https://cyberdefenders.org/" target="_blank">CyberDefenders</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" target="_blank">HackTheBox</a>. <br>I also dabble in learning Russian (Duolingo is fantastic!)
