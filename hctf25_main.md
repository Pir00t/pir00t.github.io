For Cyber Security Awareness Month, the team at Huntress ran a CTF through the month of October with new challenges released daily. Sometimes even multiple to keep everyone busy!

This was my third year taking part, second with a team. I'm grateful for having others to rely on and bounce ideas off, especially this year when my participation was hindered due to the day job (Zero Days eh!).

Our team **7 dogs in a trenchcoat** - completed 89.2% of the challenges; finishing in 138th place overall. A solid effort considering we all had things preventing us from spending as much time as we may have liked on some of the challenges.

In the links below I'll be providing my solutions to the challenges which are grouped together by category (rather than day of release). I've tried to keep the pages clutter free, with short descriptions where possible then the flag. Some challenges will be more verbose and have code or screenshots to evidence my approach! **Note: some challenges listed had already been solved by teammates, but I still wanted to walkthrough my process to each problem for getting the flag.**
