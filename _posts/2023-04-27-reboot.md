Hello, **welcome** to my _rebooted_ blog! 

Having initially put off making a blog; I created one...Things were great, I'd edited the theme, added a couple posts etc. etc. That lasted about a month or so before I kinda forgot about the whole thing for like 3/4 years!

Fast forward to now, and I've decided to try and reboot the blog and see if I can actually keep it updated in some shape or form.

Here is a list of what kind of content I hope to publish on here:
- CTF Challenge Write-ups
- Coding Project Updates
- General Cyber Tips - Family friendly
- HowTo Guides - Cyber Tooling
- Malware Analysis Write-ups

> **(Disclaimer: I can't say for sure my content will be any good but lets wait and see :sweat_smile: For anyone reading this that is into video games, the theme I'll be trying to resonate across the blog is FFVII (as well as other game/TV interests). I may also throw in some personal pics as post headers because, why not.)**

First post - completed it...again :wink:
